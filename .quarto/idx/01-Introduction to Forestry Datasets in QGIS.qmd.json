Description of data is included in @sec-data.\n\n## Background {.unnumbered}\n\nMalcolm Knapp Research Forest is a UBC affiliated research forest that is located near Maple Ridge, BC. The forest was established in 1949 and is managed by staff to be *commercially viable* and *financially independent* of UBC. The forest is \\~5,000 ha and covers a large mountainous area. Most of the forest is located in the Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone. As a result, some of the trees are very large (\\> 2 m than diameter and over 65 m).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 1: Set Up QGIS {.unnumbered}\n\n**Step 1:** Open QGIS on your laptop. Choose 'blank project.' Save the project with a file name that you can remember and location you can remember. Ex: Exercise1_Map.qgz\n\nWhen you first open QGIS you will notice a main map canvas. To the left of this map canvas are two windows **Browser** and **Layers**. The **Layers** panel is the best way to understand the order of data on the main map canvas and is the best way to change the data presentation (symbology) and access the data in tabular format. On the top the QGIS menu are a series of additional buttons which we will introduce throughout this lab and course. Finally, on the bottom are the details of the map canvas including the current center or selected coordinate, the map scale, rotation, and the coordinate reference system (CRS).\n\n**Step 2:** Set the project CRS. In BC, the provincial standard CRS is NAD83/BC Albers map projection (EPSG:3005). To set the projects CRS navigate to the bottom left of the window and click on the **EPSG:4326 as shown below:**\n\nSearch for EPSG:3005 and **click apply** and **ok**.\n\n**Step 3:** Set up a 'favorites' folder to easily access the MKRF data. Right click on 'Favorites' and click **add a directory**. Navigate to the storage location for you MKRF data. Click **ok**.\n\n#### Building Familiarity {.unnumbered}\n\n**Step 4:** Add **P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg** to the map. From the **browser** window select the file and **drag and drop** into the main map. This will add the boundary MRKF as a polygon feature. This layer is shown in the main map and listed in 'layers' on the left-hand 'layers' panel.\n\n**Step 5:** Change the symbology of the boundary file by right clicking on **P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg** in the layers pane. Select **Properties**. A window will pop-up. On the left-hand side the layer properties including: General, Source, Symbology, Labels, Fields, Joins, Diagrams. Select **Symbology** (The icon with the paintbrush). Keep the format as 'single symbol.' Change the layer to have a black outline with no fill by clicking on the icon 'simple fill.' Change the fill color to 'transparent' and the stroke width to '0.2.'\n\n**Step 6:** Add **L_streams_major.gkpg**. In the 'layers' panel this will be the first, reflecting that this layer is above the boundary file. Change the color to something that represents streams (like.. blue?).\n\n**Step 7:** Navigate the around the map project by selecting the ![](images/clipboard-2808075886.png) icon. You can use the ![](images/clipboard-1487886273.png){width=\"92\"} to zoom and out.\n\n**Step 8:** Add the **P_lakes.gpgk**. Right-click on this layer in the layers panel and select **Attribute Table**. This gives details about the polygon features of the dataset. The shape area for each has been calculated in the 'Shape_Area' field.\n\n### Question 1: {.unnumbered}\n\nHow many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg?\n\n### Question 2: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhere are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 2: Making a Site Index Map {#sec-maps .unnumbered}\n\n[Site index is a measure of productivity]{.underline}. It is technically defined as: [*expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age*]{.underline}. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is Douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like Whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\n\n**Step 1** Load **P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg**. Right click on the layer in the **layers** window and select **Open Attribute Table**. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for **SITEINDX** to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have \"0.0 m\" for a site index value. Scroll right to the \"Non-Forest Descriptor\" or **NFD** columbn. Here notes like \"NSR\" note sites that are \"not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\n\n**Step 2** Click to the **SITEINDX** column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See @sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\n\n**Step 3** Right click on the **P_ForestCover_1989** layer again in the **layers** panel and select **Properties**\n\nA.  Select **Symbology** and change the symbol from \"Single Symbol\" to \"Graduated.\"\n\nB.  Under **Value** click the small down arrow on the right to select the \"SITEINDX\" column.\n\nC.  In the **Color ramp** field click the small down arrow on the right to select the \"Viridis\" color palette.\n\nD.  At the bottom of the symbology window, select **Classify**. This will classify the values in \"SITEINDX\" based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\n\nE.  Under **Classify** and **Mode** select \"Equal Interval\" and change the number of **classes** to \"12\". Click **Classify** again.\n\nF.  In the **Classes** pain (the main white box) change these to **5 m classes** as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\n\nG.  Click **Apply and OK**. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer.\n\n![](images/QGIS%20image.jpg)\n\n**Step 4** Create a site index map to export as a picture.\n\n::: {#tip-mapmaking .callout-tip} \ncheck out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS \n[QGIS Beautiful Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJGLaH4Tvg)\n:::\n\nA.  Select **Project** -\\> **New Print out** **Layout**. Name your print layout \"MRKF_1989SiteIndex\" and click **OK.** A blank space appears in a new window with new Layout icons along the left-hand side.\n\nB.  In the left-hand of this new window, select ![](images/clipboard-3366220892.png) to (**Add a New Map to the Layout)**. A **+** sign appears as a cursor. Drag the cursor around the blank area. Your map appears in this print layout.  **NOTE:** If you do not see a map in **Layout View** use **Zoom Whole Page** You may also need to reposition the map in the copied box using:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3626068356.png){width=\"247\" height=\"301\"}\n\nC.  **Right click** on your map and select **Page Properties**. Change the orientation from \"landscape\" to \"portrait\".  \n\nD.  **Right click** on the map again and select **Item Properties** this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\n\nE.  Use ![](images/clipboard-559090363.png) on the left-hand side to add a **Legend** (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\n\nF.  Use ![](images/clipboard-1747724821.png) to add a **Scale Bar.** Click on the **Item Properties** box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\n\nG.  Use ![](images/clipboard-769114577.png) to add a **Title**.\n\nH.  Add a north arrow by clicking ![](images/clipboard-1756855161.png) and drag the curse to the map area.\n\nI.  Right click on each item on your map and select **Item Properties** to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is **Item properties** icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.\n\n**Step 5** Export your map as an image. Go to **Layout** and select **Export as Image.** Save the image the same location as your document you are recording lab responses.\n\n### Question 3: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat was the largest site index in m? What was the leading or dominant species for that polygon? Give the full name and the Latin name for the species.\n\n### Question 4: {.unnumbered}\n\nAdd 5 m contours onto your map canvas. Where are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?\n\n### Map 1 {.unnumbered style=\"Color: navy\"}\n\nInclude your Site Index Map with a proper title, legend, scale, and arrow bar.\n\n![](images/Map1.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 3: Visualize Stands Dominated by Western Redcedar in 1989 {.unnumbered}\n\n**Step 1** Close the **Layout** window and go back to the **Data view** window again.\n\n**Step 2** Change the **fc_1989**-layer properties to a **Single Symbol** again.\n\n**Step 3** Right click on the **fc_1989** layer and choose **Open Attribute Table**. Each line of this table shows the attributes for one polygon (including **SITEINDX** that you already used). You can see the total number of polygons at the top of the **Attribute Table** (1149 polygons). Keep this attribute table open in this new window.\n\n**Step 4** Select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and the cedar is more than 50% of the species composition. To do so you will use a \"Query.\" To select [polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and more than 50% of the species composition,]{.underline} you will need to do a query.\n\nA.  In the **Attribute Table** select ![](images/clipboard-3366763250.png) to open up the **Query Fields**.\n\nB.  Scroll down a bit to find \"SPSC1\" and \"PCT1\", select for **SPSC1**=C and **PCT1**\\>=50. Click **Select Features**.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1889425914.png){width=\"360\"}\n\nC.  Click the ![](images/clipboard-633541715.png) to return to the tabular format. You can see that we have now selected have a SPCS1 (leading species) of \"C\" for cedar, and that these polygons are \\>= 50%. Use this to answer **question 5**.\n\n**Step 6** Export your selection under it's own shapefile. You can minimize or close the attribute table. In the **layers** panel right click and select **Export -\\> Save Selected Features As** save this as a gpkg file in the same folder as your MRKF data. Name this **P_FC_1989_CedarLeading.gpkg**.\n\n**Step 7** Calculate the area and volume of cedar dominant stands in 1989.\n\nA.  Click on the **vector** icon in the top menu and go to **Analysis Tools -\\> Basic Statistics for Fields**.\n\nB.  In the pop-up window select your P_FC_1989_CedarLeading shapefile. In the **field to calculate statistics on** click the downward arrow and select \"Shape_Area.\" Since this is a simple calculation, we will run this as a \"temporary output.\" Therefore, click **Run** on the bottom right.\n\nC. In the window that appears, find the **count, mean, and sum values**. Use these to answer question 7 and question 8.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1197445832.png){width=\"464\"}\n\n![](images/clipboard-30022994.png){width=\"342\"}\n\n**Step 9** Calculate the merchantable volume in the 1989 cedar dominant stands.\n\nA.  Right click on the P_FC_1989_Cedarleading layer. Find the **Field Calculator** ![](images/clipboard-1506137763.png) tool.\n\nB.  In the pop-up window make sure **Create a new field** is checked. Input a formula to calculate shape area on. To calculate volume for the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have **VOL7_5** which is the volume of trees per hectare that are \\> 7.5 cm. We also have **Shape_Area** which is the area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate the volume per polygon.\n\n    $$Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha)$$ {#eq-volume}\n\nC.  Do a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape_area is in m² and VOL7_5 is in m³/ha. If we want output to be in m³ what value do we need to for XX?\n\nD.  Name the field \"m3_volume.\" Change the **Output field type** to \"Decimal number (real)\" and click **ok.** Estimates for volume for each polygon will now appear. Use these outputs to answer **Question 9**.\n\nE.  Use the **Calculate basic statistics tool** to calculate the average and total merchantable volumes in the cedar leading polygons.\n\n**Step 8** Make a map of the polygons dominated by Western redcedar. Look back towards @tip-mapmaking to remind yourself of the process and the essential components to include in your map.\n\n### Question 5: {.unnumbered}\n\nA.  How many Western redcedar (\\>= 50%) polygons were there in 1989?\nB.  Where are they located?\nC.  What polygons are not selected with the filter applied to the data?\n\n### Question 6: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the FULL latin name for Western Redcedar (including the namer - a reference to the person that named the species)?\n\n### Question 7: {#sec-Q7 .unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the average polygon size (ha) for the Western redcedar dominated stands in 1989? NOTE: 10,000 m2=1 ha (i.e., 1 ha is 100m X 100 m = 10,000 m2)\n\n### Question 8: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the total area in ha of all these selected polygons combined?\n\n### Question 9: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the value of XX in @eq-volume above? Using this equation, hat is the merchantable m3 volume (i.e., merchantable volume for trees 7.50 DBH or larger) for all these selected polygons combined? Do you feel like this a lot? (for reference a utility pole is 1m\\^\\^3)\n\n### Map 2: {.unnumbered style=\"Color: navy\"}\n\nInclude your map describing historically dominant cedar stands with a proper title, legend, scale, and arrow bar.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 4: Compare Changes in Western Redcedar from 1999 to 1989 {.unnumbered}\n\nWhew - you made it through the first interaction with QGIS in this course. Congrats 🎉. Your instructors used the same steps that you used for 989 to map and to get some statistics for Western redcedar dominated stands, but this time for 1999.  There were 1,220 polygons in 1999 and 170 were dominated by Western redcedar (Figure 1). The average polygon size for these stands was 3.90 ha with a total number of ha of 662.53 ha.  The merchantable volume for all of these stands combined was 319,903.0 m^3^.\n\n### Question 10: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhich year (1999 or 1989) had a larger polygon size for western red-cedar dominated stands? Please answer in hectares.\n\n### Question 11: {.unnumbered}\n\nDid the volume (m\\^\\^3) for all these selected polygons combined increase or decrease from 1989 to 1999?\n\n### Question 12: {.unnumbered}\n\nBased on your knowledge of forest dynamics so far, what might have caused these differences area and volume of Western redcedar dominated stands between 1989 and 1999? HINT: Think about what human (e.g., new roads, harvests, silvicultural treatments, etc.) and natural (e.g., fires, landslides, etc.) disturbances may have occurred for MKRF in the CWH BEC zone in particular.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Lab Questions & Deliverables {.unnumbered}\n\n-   [ ] Complete answers to the following questions:\n\n    -   [ ] Question 1: How many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg\n    -   [ ] Question 2: Where are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south and relative to roads?\n    -   [ ] Question 3: What was the largest site index in m?

In the left-hand of this new window, select ![](images/clipboard-3366220892.png) to (**Add a New Map to the Layout)**. A **+** sign appears as a cursor. Drag the cursor around the blank area. Your map appears in this print layout.  **NOTE:** If you do not see a map in **Layout View** use **Zoom Whole Page** You may also need to reposition the map in the copied box using:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3626068356.png){width=\"247\" height=\"301\"}\n\nC.  **Right click** on your map and select **Page Properties**. Change the orientation from \"landscape\" to \"portrait\".  \n\nD.  **Right click** on the map again and select **Item Properties** this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\n\nE.  Use ![](images/clipboard-559090363.png) on the left-hand side to add a **Legend** (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\n\nF.  Use ![](images/clipboard-1747724821.png) to add a **Scale Bar.** Click on the **Item Properties** box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\n\nG.  Use ![](images/clipboard-769114577.png) to add a **Title**.\n\nH.  Add a north arrow by clicking ![](images/clipboard-1756855161.png) and drag the curse to the map area.\n\nI.  Right click on each item on your map and select **Item Properties** to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is **Item properties** icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.\n\n**Step 5** Export your map as an image. Go to **Layout** and select **Export as Image.** Save the image the same location as your document you are recording lab responses.\n\n### Question 3: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat was the largest site index in m? What was the leading or dominant species for that polygon? Give the full name and the Latin name for the species.\n\n### Question 4: {.unnumbered}\n\nAdd 5 m contours onto your map canvas. Where are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?\n\n### Map 1 {.unnumbered style=\"Color: navy\"}\n\nInclude your Site Index Map with a proper title, legend, scale, and arrow bar.\n\n![](images/Map1.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 3: Visualize Stands Dominated by Western Redcedar in 1989 {.unnumbered}\n\n**Step 1** Close the **Layout** window and go back to the **Data view** window again.\n\n**Step 2** Change the **fc_1989**-layer properties to a **Single Symbol** again.\n\n**Step 3** Right click on the **fc_1989** layer and choose **Open Attribute Table**. Each line of this table shows the attributes for one polygon (including **SITEINDX** that you already used). You can see the total number of polygons at the top of the **Attribute Table** (1149 polygons). Keep this attribute table open in this new window.\n\n**Step 4** Select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and the cedar is more than 50% of the species composition. To do so you will use a \"Query.\" To select [polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and more than 50% of the species composition,]{.underline} you will need to do a query.\n\nA.  In the **Attribute Table** select ![](images/clipboard-3366763250.png) to open up the **Query Fields**.\n\nB.  Scroll down a bit to find \"SPSC1\" and \"PCT1\", select for **SPSC1**=C and **PCT1**\\>=50. Click **Select Features**.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1889425914.png){width=\"360\"}\n\nC.  Click the ![](images/clipboard-633541715.png) to return to the tabular format. You can see that we have now selected have a SPCS1 (leading species) of \"C\" for cedar, and that these polygons are \\>= 50%. Use this to answer **question 5**.\n\n**Step 6** Export your selection under it's own shapefile. You can minimize or close the attribute table. In the **layers** panel right click and select **Export -\\> Save Selected Features As** save this as a gpkg file in the same folder as your MRKF data. Name this **P_FC_1989_CedarLeading.gpkg**.\n\n**Step 7** Calculate the area and volume of cedar dominant stands in 1989.\n\nA.  Click on the **vector** icon in the top menu and go to **Analysis Tools -\\> Basic Statistics for Fields**.\n\nB.  In the pop-up window select your P_FC_1989_CedarLeading shapefile. In the **field to calculate statistics on** click the downward arrow and select \"Shape_Area.\" Since this is a simple calculation, we will run this as a \"temporary output.\" Therefore, click **Run** on the bottom right.\n\nC. In the window that appears, find the **count, mean, and sum values**. Use these to answer question 7 and question 8.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1197445832.png){width=\"464\"}\n\n![](images/clipboard-30022994.png){width=\"342\"}\n\n**Step 9** Calculate the merchantable volume in the 1989 cedar dominant stands.\n\nA.  Right click on the P_FC_1989_Cedarleading layer. Find the **Field Calculator** ![](images/clipboard-1506137763.png) tool.\n\nB.  In the pop-up window make sure **Create a new field** is checked. Input a formula to calculate shape area on. To calculate volume for the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have **VOL7_5** which is the volume of trees per hectare that are \\> 7.5 cm. We also have **Shape_Area** which is the area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate the volume per polygon.\n\n    $$Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha)$$ {#eq-volume}\n\nC.  Do a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape_area is in m² and VOL7_5 is in m³/ha. If we want output to be in m³ what value do we need to for XX?\n\nD.  Name the field \"m3_volume.\" Change the **Output field type** to \"Decimal number (real)\" and click **ok.** Estimates for volume for each polygon will now appear. Use these outputs to answer **Question 9**.\n\nE.  Use the **Calculate basic statistics tool** to calculate the average and total merchantable volumes in the cedar leading polygons.\n\n**Step 8** Make a map of the polygons dominated by Western redcedar. Look back towards @tip-mapmaking to remind yourself of the process and the essential components to include in your map.\n\n### Question 5: {.unnumbered}\n\nA.  How many Western redcedar (\\>= 50%) polygons were there in 1989?\nB.  Where are they located?\nC.  What polygons are not selected with the filter applied to the data?\n\n### Question 6: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the FULL latin name for Western Redcedar (including the namer - a reference to the person that named the species)?\n\n### Question 7: {#sec-Q7 .unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the average polygon size (ha) for the Western redcedar dominated stands in 1989? NOTE: 10,000 m2=1 ha (i.e., 1 ha is 100m X 100 m = 10,000 m2)\n\n### Question 8: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the total area in ha of all these selected polygons combined?\n\n### Question 9: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat is the value of XX in @eq-volume above? Using this equation, hat is the merchantable m3 volume (i.e., merchantable volume for trees 7.50 DBH or larger) for all these selected polygons combined? Do you feel like this a lot? (for reference a utility pole is 1m\\^\\^3)\n\n### Map 2: {.unnumbered style=\"Color: navy\"}\n\nInclude your map describing historically dominant cedar stands with a proper title, legend, scale, and arrow bar.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 4: Compare Changes in Western Redcedar from 1999 to 1989 {.unnumbered}\n\nWhew - you made it through the first interaction with QGIS in this course. Congrats 🎉. Your instructors used the same steps that you used for 989 to map and to get some statistics for Western redcedar dominated stands, but this time for 1999.  There were 1,220 polygons in 1999 and 170 were dominated by Western redcedar (Figure 1). The average polygon size for these stands was 3.90 ha with a total number of ha of 662.53 ha.  The merchantable volume for all of these stands combined was 319,903.0 m^3^.\n\n### Question 10: {.unnumbered}\n\nWhich year (1999 or 1989) had a larger polygon size for western red-cedar dominated stands? Please answer in hectares.\n\n### Question 11: {.unnumbered}\n\nDid the volume (m\\^\\^3) for all these selected polygons combined increase or decrease from 1989 to 1999?\n\n### Question 12: {.unnumbered}\n\nBased on your knowledge of forest dynamics so far, what might have caused these differences area and volume of Western redcedar dominated stands between 1989 and 1999? HINT: Think about what human (e.g., new roads, harvests, silvicultural treatments, etc.) and natural (e.g., fires, landslides, etc.) disturbances may have occurred for MKRF in the CWH BEC zone in particular.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Lab Questions & Deliverables {.unnumbered}\n\n-   [ ] Complete answers to the following questions:\n\n    -   [ ] Question 1: How many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg\n    -   [ ] Question 2: Where are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south and relative to roads?\n    -   [ ] Question 3: What was the largest site index in m?
