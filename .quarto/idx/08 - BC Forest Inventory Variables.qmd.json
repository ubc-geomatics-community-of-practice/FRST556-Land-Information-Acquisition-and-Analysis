What? Where? Why?\n\n-   **Criteria:** Describe the criteria you will use to assess which land areas might meet the objective(s).  For each of these criteria, explain why it is needed to meet the objective(s).\n\n-   **Data Needed:** In an EXCEL file:\n\n    -   List the map layers that you will need to find the land areas that fulfill your criteria. For each of these, provide a short description (**what**, **where**, **when** (i.e., what date)), and a source of these data (**who**). Be as specific as possible including a website for the data if the data are publicly available, or a contact agency, contact person, and cost if the data are not publicly available. Also, state **why** these data are needed for one or more of your criteria.\n\n    -   List the remotely sensed data that you will need to find the land areas that fulfill your criteria. For each of these, provide a short description (**what**, **where**, **when** (i.e., what date)), and a source of these data (**who**). Be as specific as possible including a website for the data if the data are publicly available, or a contact agency, contact person, and cost if the data are not publicly available. Also, state **why** these data are needed for one or more of your criteria.\n\n    -   Will you need any ground-based data? If this is essential, then, for each of these, provide a short description (**what, where, when**), and a source of these data (**who**). Be as specific as possible or a contact agency, contact person, and cost if the data are not publicly available. Also, state **why** these data are needed for one or more of your criteria.\n\n-   **Workflow**: Describe the general workflow steps you would need to follow. [The workflow should follow a logical flow of steps used to analyze the data to meet the criteria]{.underline}.  For this, consider:\n\n    -   **What step should be done first**? Why? What data will be used for that step, and what will be done with the data?\n\n    -   **What will be done next**? Why? What data will be needed?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Forest Management Problems {#sec-problems .unnumbered}\n\n::: callout-note\nWhile these are all fictional, they are based on actual forest management projects\n:::\n\n**Group 1**\n\nA professional biologist’s group is concerned that high-school students in the greater Vancouver area have had little or no experience in natural areas.  They would like to provide a one-day workshop for 30 students that would focus on outdoor experiences as a pilot program, with the long-term objective of providing these workshops for 120 students per year.  For safety reasons, they plan to conduce the workshops in May when weather conditions might be better. They have obtained approval to conduct the workshops in the Mount Seymour Provincial Park <https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/mt_seymour>, just north of Vancouver. The students will have varying levels of abilities to walk in natural areas.  They have asked you to come up with a number of suitable areas within the park for activities of this workshop.\n\n::: callout-tip\n*Some things to consider: What areas should be avoided? (Will students be able to walk over steep terrain? Will there be areas with snow?) What other uses might be competing with this student group use? Then, what should the teachers highlight for this student group? What should students learn about the natural environment? Where would you find these opportunities within the Park?*\n:::\n\n**Group 2**\n\nThe Emily Car School of Design has contacted the Mission Municipal Forest near Mission ([www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry](http://www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry)), BC about possibly supplying raw materials for creative wood designs. They are particularly interested in using hardwood materials. A number of the art and furniture pieces they would like to create are quite large, requiring bigger trees.  They are not able to pay a lot for the materials.  Also, they would like to have the materials in March next year.  The Director of Forestry for the Mission Municipal Forest (TFL26) asks you for some options to obtain 100 m^3^ of materials that might meet their needs.  You are asked to be particularly careful with the costs of obtaining the materials to keep costs down. At the same time, environmental concerns must be considered in any timber extractions, as well as any conflicts with other activities in this Forest. \n\n::: callout-tip\n*Some things to consider: For this, first which hardwoods (literature)? Where are they? Are they large enough?  What about harvest and transport costs (Close to roads? )  Then, which areas to get 100 m^3^? What other activities might be competing with this request for materials? Environmental concerns?*\n:::\n\n**Group 3**\n\nDucks Unlimited ([www.ducks.ca](http://www.ducks.ca) ) has obtained some interest from a private donor for sponsoring a bird habitat reservation area near Vancouver.  The Mayor of Mission hears about this and decides to make a “pitch” for a possible reservation of 30 ha within public lands near Mission, possibly within the Mission Community Forest ([www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry](http://www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry) or adjacent to it. You are asked to provide some options as to where this area should be located, as well as the reasons for this choice.  Since the interest was from Ducks Unlimited, there is particular interest in conserving water birds.\n\n::: callout-tip\n*Some things to consider: First, what do birds need (literature)? Shelter + food + nesting habitat? Hardwoods for nesting birds? Should these be near roads or not? Near water?*\n:::\n\n**Group 4**\n\nThe fire return interval in the District of North Vancouver has been more than 100 years. However, with changes in climate, there are concerns that this may be changing to shorter intervals (<https://www.dnv.org/community-environment/community-wildfire-protection-plan> ) The District has obtained additional funds to reduce wildfire risks.  They would like to know where areas of higher fire risk might be, along with areas where fires might result in greater losses (timber, buildings, and other losses).  They expect to be able to reduce fire risk on 50 ha in the next year via selective (i.e., partial) harvest to reduce the amount of combustible materials. They have asked you to provide a few options as to which 50 ha they should target this year.  \n\n::: callout-tip\n*Some things to consider for the information bits needed: First, what is considered a lower fire hazard (literature?) – elevation? Near lakes/rivers? Then, should the 50 ha be all in one space – or spread out over the District? How might any negative perceptions by publics regarding these forest changes be ameliorated though area selection?*\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Lab Questions & Deliverables {#sec-turnin .unnumbered}\n\n-   [ ] A Short report including\n\n    -   [ ] Introduction: Provide a description of the management problem that you are addressing as separate introduction section.
