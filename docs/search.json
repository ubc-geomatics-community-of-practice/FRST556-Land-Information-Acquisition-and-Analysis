    "text": "Data Description\nYou decide to use a systematic sampling approach to determine plot centres for n=4 plots. For each plot center, you establish a circular, fixed-area plot (r=11.27 m; 0.04 ha) aiming to sample all trees which are ≥ 2.0 cm DBH within this radius. Some plots had a lot of trees and thus a process of “Half Sweeps” was conducted, where a randomly chosen half of the 0.04 ha (or a slice) was selected and only trees in that half of the plot were recorded (i.e., each tree counts twice in the 0.04 ha plot OR the plot size was reduced to 0.02 ha).\nFor each tree (DBH≥2.0 cm) in the plot (full or half plot), the species was recorded and the DBH (cm) was measured. On a subset of trees, the height (m) was measured in the field. For the remaining trees, the height was estimated in the office using existing height/DBH models (i.e., for each tree without height, the species-specific models developed for this area were used to estimate height from DBH).  For broken trees, the height to the break was measured in the field, and an estimate of the height that the tree might have been if not broken was also recorded in the field. A snapshot of these data are provided below.\nFrom these data, you determine the characteristics of the forest land and report these to the landowner, along with your estimate of potential carbon credits.\n\n\n\nDescription of four selected plots including # trees & plot type\n\n\nPlotNo\nnumber_trees\nplot_type\n\n\n\n\n1\n15\nHalf\n\n\n2\n21\nFull\n\n\n3\n10\nHalf\n\n\n4\n12\nFull"

    "text": "Forest Management Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile these are all fictional, they are based on actual forest management projects\n\n\nGroup 1\nA professional biologist’s group is concerned that high-school students in the greater Vancouver area have had little or no experience in natural areas. They would like to provide a one-day workshop for 30 students that would focus on outdoor experiences as a pilot program. The longer term objective is to provide these workshops for up to 120 students per year. For safety reasons, they plan to conduce the workshops in May when weather conditions might be better. They have obtained approval to conduct the workshops in the Mount Seymour Provincial Park https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/mt_seymour, just north of Vancouver. The students will have varying levels of abilities to walk in natural areas. They have asked you to come up with a number of suitable areas within the park for activities of this workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: What areas should be avoided? (Will students be able to walk over steep terrain? Will there be areas with snow?) What other uses might be competing with this student group use? Then, what should the teachers highlight for this student group? What should students learn about the natural environment? Where would you find these opportunities within the Park?\n\n\nGroup 2\nThe Emily Car School of Design has contacted the Mission Municipal Forest near Mission (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry), BC about possibly supplying raw materials for creative wood designs. They are particularly interested in using hardwood materials. A number of the art and furniture pieces they would like to create are quite large, requiring bigger trees. They are not able to pay a lot for the materials.  Also, they would like to have the materials in March next year.  The Director of Forestry for the Mission Municipal Forest (TFL26) asks you for some options to obtain 100 m3 of materials that might meet their needs. You are asked to be particularly careful with the costs of obtaining the materials to keep costs down. At the same time, environmental concerns must be considered in any timber extractions, as well as any conflicts with other activities in this Forest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: For this, first which hardwoods (literature)? Where are they? Are they large enough?  What about harvest and transport costs (Close to roads? )  Then, which areas to get 100 m3? What other activities might be competing with this request for materials? Environmental concerns?\n\n\nGroup 3\nDucks Unlimited (www.ducks.ca ) has obtained some interest from a private donor for sponsoring a bird habitat reservation area near Vancouver. The Mayor of Mission hears about this and decides to make a “pitch” for a possible reservation of 30 ha within public lands near Mission, possibly within the Mission Community Forest (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry or adjacent to it. You are asked to provide some options as to where this area should be located, as well as the reasons for this choice. Since the interest was from Ducks Unlimited, there is particular interest in conserving water birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: First, what do birds need (literature)? Shelter + food + nesting habitat? Hardwoods for nesting birds? Should these be near roads or not? Near water?\n\n\nGroup 4\nThe fire return interval in the District of North Vancouver has been more than 100 years. However, with changes in climate, there are concerns that this may be changing to shorter intervals (https://www.dnv.org/community-environment/community-wildfire-protection-plan ). The District has obtained additional funds to reduce wildfire risks. They would like to know where areas of higher fire risk might be, along with areas where fires might result in greater losses (timber, buildings, and other losses). They expect to be able to reduce fire risk on 50 ha in the next year via selective (i.e., partial) harvest to reduce the amount of combustible materials. They have asked you to provide a few options as to which 50 ha they should target this year.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider for the information bits needed: First, what is considered a lower fire hazard (literature?) – elevation? Near lakes/rivers? Then, should the 50 ha be all in one space – or spread out over the District? How might any negative perceptions by publics regarding these forest changes be ameliorated though area selection?"

The forest was established in 1949 and is managed by staff to be commercially viable and financially independent of UBC. The forest is ~5,000 ha and covers a large mountainous area. Most of the forest is located in the Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone. As a result, some of the trees are very large (&gt; 2 m than diameter and over 65 m).",

    "text": "Task 1: Set Up QGIS\nStep 1: Open QGIS on your laptop. Choose ‘blank project.’ Save the project with a file name that you can remember and location you can remember. Ex: Exercise1_Map.qgz\nWhen you first open QGIS you will notice a main map canvas. To the left of this map canvas are two windows Browser and Layers. The Layers panel is the best way to understand the order of data on the main map canvas and is the best way to change the data presentation (symbology) and access the data in tabular format. On the top the QGIS menu are a series of additional buttons which we will introduce throughout this lab and course. Finally, on the bottom are the details of the map canvas including the current center or selected coordinate, the map scale, rotation, and the coordinate reference system (CRS).\nStep 2: Set the project CRS. In BC, the provincial standard CRS is NAD83/BC Albers map projection (EPSG:3005). To set the projects CRS navigate to the bottom left of the window and click on the EPSG:4326 as shown below:\nSearch for EPSG:3005 and click apply and ok.\nStep 3: Set up a ‘favorites’ folder to easily access the MKRF data. Right click on ‘Favorites’ and click add a directory. Navigate to the storage location for you MKRF data. Click ok.\n\nBuilding Familiarity\nStep 4: Add P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg to the map. From the browser window select the file and drag and drop into the main map. This will add the boundary MRKF as a polygon feature. This layer is shown in the main map and listed in ‘layers’ on the left-hand ‘layers’ panel.\nStep 5: Change the symbology of the boundary file by right clicking on P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg in the layers pane. Select Properties. A window will pop-up. On the left-hand side the layer properties including: General, Source, Symbology, Labels, Fields, Joins, Diagrams. Select Symbology (The icon with the paintbrush). Keep the format as ‘single symbol.’ Change the layer to have a black outline with no fill by clicking on the icon ‘simple fill.’ Change the fill color to ‘transparent’ and the stroke width to ‘0.2.’\nStep 6: Add L_streams_major.gkpg. In the ‘layers’ panel this will be the first, reflecting that this layer is above the boundary file. Change the color to something that represents streams (like.. blue?).\nStep 7: Navigate the around the map project by selecting the  icon. You can use the  to zoom and out.\nStep 8: Add the P_lakes.gpgk. Right-click on this layer in the layers panel and select Attribute Table. This gives details about the polygon features of the dataset. The shape area for each has been calculated in the ‘Shape_Area’ field.\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nHow many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg?\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWhere are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?",

    "text": "Task 2: Making a Site Index Map\nSite index is a measure of productivity. It is technically defined as: expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is Douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like Whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\nStep 1 Load P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg. Right click on the layer in the layers window and select Open Attribute Table. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for SITEINDX to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have “0.0 m” for a site index value. Scroll right to the “Non-Forest Descriptor” or NFD columbn. Here notes like “NSR” note sites that are “not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\nStep 2 Click to the SITEINDX column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See ?sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\nStep 3 Right click on the P_ForestCover_1989 layer again in the layers panel and select Properties\n\nSelect Symbology and change the symbol from “Single Symbol” to “Graduated.”\nUnder Value click the small down arrow on the right to select the “SITEINDX” column.\nIn the Color ramp field click the small down arrow on the right to select the “Viridis” color palette.\nAt the bottom of the symbology window, select Classify. This will classify the values in “SITEINDX” based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\nUnder Classify and Mode select “Equal Interval” and change the number of classes to “12”. Click Classify again.\nIn the Classes pain (the main white box) change these to 5 m classes as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\nClick Apply and OK. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer.\n\n\nStep 4 Create a site index map to export as a picture. ::: {#tip-mapmaking .callout-tip} check out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS :::\n\nSelect Project -&gt; New Print out Layout. Name your print layout “MRKF_1989SiteIndex” and click OK. A blank space appears in a new window with new Layout icons along the left-hand side.\nIn the left-hand of this new window, select  to (Add a New Map to the Layout). A + sign appears as a cursor. Drag the cursor around the blank area. Your map appears in this print layout.  NOTE: If you do not see a map in Layout View use Zoom Whole Page You may also need to reposition the map in the copied box using:\n\n\n\nRight click on your map and select Page Properties. Change the orientation from “landscape” to “portrait”.  \nRight click on the map again and select Item Properties this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\nUse  on the left-hand side to add a Legend (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\nUse  to add a Scale Bar. Click on the Item Properties box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\nUse  to add a Title.\nAdd a north arrow by clicking  and drag the curse to the map area.\nRight click on each item on your map and select Item Properties to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is Item properties icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.\n\nStep 5 Export your map as an image. Go to Layout and select Export as Image. Save the image the same location as your document you are recording lab responses.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWhat was the largest site index in m? What was the leading or dominant species for that polygon? Give the full name and the Latin name for the species.\n\n\nQuestion 4:\nAdd 5 m contours onto your map canvas. Where are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?\n\n\nMap 1\nInclude your Site Index Map with a proper title, legend, scale, and arrow bar."

Each line of this table shows the attributes for one polygon (including SITEINDX that you already used). You can see the total number of polygons at the top of the Attribute Table (1149 polygons). Keep this attribute table open in this new window.\nStep 4 Select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and the cedar is more than 50% of the species composition. To do so you will use a “Query.” To select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and more than 50% of the species composition, you will need to do a query.\n\nIn the Attribute Table select  to open up the Query Fields.\nScroll down a bit to find “SPSC1” and “PCT1”, select for SPSC1=C and PCT1&gt;=50. Click Select Features.\n\nClick the  to return to the tabular format. You can see that we have now selected have a SPCS1 (leading species) of “C” for cedar, and that these polygons are &gt;= 50%.

In the field to calculate statistics on click the downward arrow and select “Shape_Area.” Since this is a simple calculation, we will run this as a “temporary output.” Therefore, click Run on the bottom right.\n\nC. In the window that appears, find the count, mean, and sum values. Use these to answer question 7 and question 8.\n\n\nStep 9 Calculate the merchantable volume in the 1989 cedar dominant stands.\n\nRight click on the P_FC_1989_Cedarleading layer. Find the Field Calculator  tool.\nIn the pop-up window make sure Create a new field is checked. Input a formula to calculate shape area on. To calculate volume for the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have VOL7_5 which is the volume of trees per hectare that are &gt; 7.5 cm. We also have Shape_Area which is the area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate the volume per polygon.\n\\[Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha) \\tag{2.1}\\]\nDo a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape_area is in m² and VOL7_5 is in m³/ha. If we want output to be in m³ what value do we need to for XX?\nName the field “m3_volume.” Change the Output field type to “Decimal number (real)” and click ok. Estimates for volume for each polygon will now appear. Use these outputs to answer Question 9.\nUse the Calculate basic statistics tool to calculate the average and total merchantable volumes in the cedar leading polygons.\n\nStep 8 Make a map of the polygons dominated by Western redcedar.

    "section": "Lab Overview",
    "text": "Lab Overview\nBritish Columbia relies heavily on surveying from aerial imagery to understand forest dynamics. Aerial surveys have been used throughout BC’s recent history to understand forest composition and health. Aerial imagery is the key input into the vegetation resource inventory (or VRI) which describe composition of BCs forests. The VRI process has two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Using aerial imagery, forests are divided into homogeneous areas called “polygons.”\nPhase 2: Ground-reference plots are placed systematically throughout polygons. Ground-reference plots are used to determine the site-type or biogeoclimatic zone and subzone of each area. You can find more information on this process here.\n\nThese data are collectively used to obtain information on the forests of BC. However, since forests change over time, VRI also includes regular updates of original VRI data to reflect changes in forest composition associated with:\n\nLarge-scale natural disturbances: e.g., fires, insects, windthrow, etc.\nHuman disturbances: e.g., clear-cuts, partial harvests, roads, new urban areas, etc.\n\nThese new openings result in changes to polygon boundaries and attributes relative to prior dates for the same land area.  In addition, the attributes of each forested polygon are forecasted for stand-level growth to the current date (labelled as “Projected”).  For example, if the stand age was 50 years in 2000, the updated age (called “Projected Age”) in 2015 is 50+15=65 years. There are some attributes such as species composition that cannot be accurately updated via a forecast.  At some point, a re-inventory is needed. Typically, the Province does not regularly update the VRI layers for disturbances on private lands. The VRI for MKRF was actually updated to an entirely new reference year in 2020. We’ve included this data with the course and will introduce it at the end of lab. You can see that the 2014 VRI is largely the same as the 1996 VRI, but when the VRI was updated to a new reference year there were many changes."

    "text": "Task 1: Discover the difference between “Forest Cover” and VRI\nLast week, we used forest cover polygons to look at the forest cover from 1989 and briefly compared changes between 1989 and 1999. These forest cover polygons were created using interpretation of aerial imagery. Both VRI and forest cover polygons intrept components of forests using aerial imagery. However, their standards for photo-interpretation are different.\nIn our dataset, the forest cover polygons are based on photointepretation of 1987 photos, while the 2014 VRI is based on a 19996 aerial survey. Forest cover polygons are updated for natural and human disturbances, whereas VRI polygons are updated for the same disturbances. VRI polygons are also projected to the updated year. Additionally, VRI includes information on four different forest structure layers, from top canopy to the shrub layer. In this lab, we will work with the top of canopy layer. You can find out more on what attributes are recorded in the VRI data dictionary.\n\nBuilding Familiarity with VRI data\nStep 1: Open QGIS and save a new map project. Set up this project similarly to how we did in Task 1 lab 1 ?sec-maps.\nStep 2: Add the following layers to your blank map:\n\nP_Boundary_MRKF\nP_BC_VRI_2014\nP_ForestCover_1989\n\nStep 3: Select “P_BC_VRI_2014” and change the layer symbology. Change the outline to “white” ⬜change the fill color to “light grey” and increase the outline stroke width 0.2 mm. Click Apply and Ok.\nStep 4: Select the “P_ForestCover_1989” and change the symbology. Change the outline color to “orange🟧”.\nStep 5: Compare the VRI polygons to the 2006 Orthomosaic. Are there areas where the VRI projection does not make sense? To answer this, set the fill color for the VRI to semi-translucent and zoom to: 1250396, 481902 (*make sure your map CRS is set to BC Conus Albers; EPSG 3005). You can paste these values into the coordinate box on the bottom of the screen.\n\nStep 6: Load in P_ForestCover_2008. This is the updated forest cover layer as of 2006. Find the name of the forest disturbance that occurred in 2006 at the location identified in step 5.\n\n\n3.0.1 Question 1:\nWhich description of forest composition and structure (VRI and forest cover) has more polygons?\n\n\n3.0.2 Question 2:\nWhich descriptor of forest composition has a larger average polygon? Which one has a larger maximum polygon?\n\n\n3.0.3 Question 3:\nWhat is the projected age for the polygon at this site? Does this make sense? Why or why not? Insert a screenshot (include a figure caption!) to support your answer.\n\n\n3.0.4 Question 4:\nLook for two other forest disturbances or land-cover changes anywhere in MKRF recorded in the 2006 orthomosaic but not recorded in the 2014 VRI.\n\n\n3.0.5 Question 5:\nMalcolm Knapp is privately owned land, meaning not all disturbances are consistently added to VRI. Given this, what are some of the disadvantages of relying on VRI alone? What additional tools can we use to better update VRI? Respond in a clear and well written paragraph format."

    "text": "Task 2: Segmenting Forest Polygons\nRead through the photo-interpretation standards provided by the Ministry. Note that the linked version is version 5 - reflecting that these standards are fifth version of VRI photo-interpretation standards since 1999 (when the VRI program was established). Focus on Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. These show initial steps in segmenting the land base into forest cover polygons. You will be interpreting a 2006 photo of area of MKRF using these two figures and “heads-up digitizing.” Normally, this first step would be done using a 3-D view of overlapping aerial images. You will be using a 2-D view for this first step in photo-interpretation to get an idea of how this is initially done. These larger polygons would be further stratified using forest cover attributes, and all attributes added as documented in the VRI photo-interpretation standards.\nStep 1 Add the 2008 and the 2006 aerial imagery to your map. Note that the 2008 photo is only part of the MRKF.\nStep 2 zoom into the three following locations below. Create a formatted table to answer question 6.\nStep 3 zoom into a clearcut location in 2008. Think about what characteristics support it is harvested.\n\nQuestion 6:\nZoom into the locations noted on the table. Use the  tool located in the upper right of QGIS to retrieve RGB values for the following areas. Once you have filled in the table, discuss why you think different landcovers have different pixel values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: Remember that for a color rendition of an image, white objects reflect high in all visual bands; green objects reflect higher in the green band; blue objects reflect higher in the blue band; red objects reflect higher in the red band; and black objects have low reflectance in all visual bands.\n\n\n\nPixel brightness values for different land cover types in MKRF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nN\nLandcover\nRed Brightness\nGreen Brightness\nBlue Brightness\n\n\n\n\n1248400\n481890\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1247760\n488198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1248195\n483318\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1247019\n483138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7:\nWhen you look at a clear cut area, what characteristics support that an area is harvested?

    "section": "Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel Data",
    "text": "Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel Data\nWe have established an understanding of the key characteristics of different land cover types and how these relate to brightness values. We will now use QGIS to create a new polygon feature that will help better understand variability in pixel data, and how this variability can help us explore our datasets.\nStep 1 Create a new shapefile layer by going to Layer -&gt; Create a Layer -&gt; Create a new shapefile layer\n\nStep 2 Save your shapefile to the same location as your exercise two, name this layer “Landcover Types.shp”. For the Geometry Type select “polygon.” In the New Field window create a Text field called “class.” Make sure to click Add to Fields List. Click Ok. Your new layer should appear in the layers panel.\nStep 3 Right click on your new layer in the layers panel. Select Toggle Editing. The layer can now be actively edited.\nStep 4 Click on the polygon tool  in the upper left of the screen. This tool allows you to add new polygons to your shapefile. To add a polygon, left-click to begin a shape and add addition vertices. To finish a shape right-click. Use this process to add polygons that cover: (a) a fresh clearcut, (b) a lake, (c) an older clearcut, (d) a mixed forest, and (e) coniferous forest in the 2006 RGB image. When you finish a polygon make sure to note the landcover type in your “class” field.\n\nStep 5 once you have finished, right-click on your layer in the Layers panel to save the layer edits. Additionally, change the symbology of this layer to show the individual layer attributes. See an example in Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Landcover types for polygon based on interpretation of 2006 aerial RGB imagery. Note that 2008 is shown in background\n\n\nStep 5 We will now introduce the processing toolbox. This is a great resource for finding tools that help analyze spatial data. The processing toolbox is normally located on the upper right-hand of of the QGIS window. If it is not there, you can load it by going to View -&gt; Panels -&gt; Processing Toolbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 In the search bar located at the top of the processing toolbox type in “Zonal” and select Zonal statistics. In the pop-up window make the following selections\n\nInput layer: Select your class polygons\nRaster layer: Select the 2006 RGB image\nRaster band: Select the green band\nOutput column prefix: type “Brt” (for pixel brightness values)\nRight click on the “…” in statistics to calculate. In the new menu select (1) Mean (2) St Dec (2) Minimum and (3) Maximum\nSave the file to the same location as your exercise 2\n\n\nStep 7 Using the new shapefile, color the shapefile by mean brightness. Under symbology select “graduated” and for the color palette choose “greys.” At the top to the color palette window choose invert color ramp. Inverting the color ramp means that the polygons where the mean brightness values is low will be closer to black and polygons where the mean brightness is high will be closer to white.\nStep 8 We will now create a new map layout to showcase some the forest cover polygons we have created. Go to file New print layout and create a new map layout named “forest cover polygons.” Make the orientation of new map is horizontal. Our new map layout will have three different sub-maps. The first will describe the forest cover polygons we have created. The second will describe in the mean brightness for the RGB data we have. Finally, we will have a third map that displays the variability in the brightness responses of our different forest cover polygons.\nStep 9 We’ll start with the map that describes our forest polygons.\n\nChange the symbology of the forest polygons shapefile to give each polygon a unique color. Go to symbology -&gt; categorized -&gt; select your “class” field -&gt; and classify. Click Apply but NOT ok.\nOn the left-hand of this pop-up window go to “labels” and select Single Label for Value select your “class” field.\nClick on Buffer and check the box that says Draw text Buffer this will put a small white buffer around our labels.\nClick on Placement change the mode to Offset from centroid. Click the box that says Allow placing of labels outside of polygons. Change the Quadrant to the upper-left\nClick Apply - labels should now appear on the map canvas.\nClick Ok.\n\n\n\nNavigate back to your map layout. Insert a new map for your forest polygons. In the background, include the BC VRI and 2008 RGB image. The screenshot below highlights what should be included. Set the map scale to 70000 to best include all of MKRF.\n\n\n\nIn the right-hand side under Layers click the checkmark that says Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers this prevents your map from automatically updating.\nAdd a legend. In Legend items uncheck “auto update” and remove all legend items that are are not your forest cover polygons. On the forest polygon layer right-click to check “hidden.” In the Title for the legend put “Forest Polygon Class”\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest polygon map. With this new map selected, uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas.\n\nStep 9 We’ll now map the average green brightness value in these polygons.\n\nUsing your layer that we calculated zonal statistics on, which should still be colored black-to-white. Move this layer to the top of the map canvas.\nNavigate back to your map layout. With the copied map selected, change the name to “zonal mean.” In the item properties tab click the circular “refresh” button. This will update the map to the current canvas layers. Click Lock layers and Lock styles for Layer.\n\nCopy the Legend from your polygons layer. Change the reference map to the zonal statistics map. In the legend properties check “update all”. Change the Title to “Mean Bit Brightness (Green Band)”.\n\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest zonal statistics map. With this map selected, uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas.\n\nStep 10 Follow a similar process to step 9, but this time change the zonal statistics layer to the standard deviation. See Figure 3.2 for an example of your final output.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example output for forest cover map. **Note your map will be different according to where you place your polygons.\n\n\n\nQuestion 9:\nHow do values for your different forest polygons layer differ in terms of brightness? What feature had the highest greenness reflectance? Which feature had the most variable greenness reflectance? Use values to support your results.\n\n\nQuestion 10:\nNormally, photo-interpreters would have a 3-D view of a stereo-pair of photos and they could see and measure stand heights. What other information might help the photo-interpreter assign heights to each stand? HINT: As well as imagery, what other information might they access? How do other attributes impact height?\n\n\nMap 1:\nInclude your map describing your forest polygon layer and the associated brightness values from the 2006 orthophoto."

    "text": "Task 4: Satellite Images Compared to Aerial Photographs\nImages collected using satellites provide the base data used to create Google Maps, Google Earth Views, etc. Of these, data collected by Landsat satellites is very common used. However, other imagery is often needed to provide finer spatial detail, historic views, and 3-D views. You will learn more about other imagery in FRST 538. For now, you will look at the Landsat imagery provided for MKRF and compare these to the aerial photographs. Specifically, you will look at how these images might be used to update after natural and human disturbances.\nStep 1 Add the 2019 Landsat RGB image, keeping both the 2008 and 2006 orthoimages loaded. Clearly, there are differences in the spectral reflectance and the resolution of these two images. However, Landsat is free and has consistently captured images of our earth from two-weeks (when it is cloud free) since its launch in the 1970s.\nStep 2 Qualitatively compare the orthoimages from the satellite data. Use this to answer the last lab question.\n\nQuestion 11:\nIf you were monitoring a forest area for harvest disturbances, would you choose to get new aerial photographs or would you use available Landsat data? Consider the costs, the spatial resolution of the images relative to the disturbance size, and the frequency that images are acquired.\n\n\nQuestion 12:\nWhat about using Landsat data for something like small-scale wind damage?

    "text": "Task 2: Making a Site Index Map\nSite index is a measure of productivity. It is technically defined as: expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is Douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like Whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\nStep 1 Load P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg. Right click on the layer in the layers window and select Open Attribute Table. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for SITEINDX to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have “0.0 m” for a site index value. Scroll right to the “Non-Forest Descriptor” or NFD columbn. Here notes like “NSR” note sites that are “not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\nStep 2 Click to the SITEINDX column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See ?sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\nStep 3 Right click on the P_ForestCover_1989 layer again in the layers panel and select Properties\n\nSelect Symbology and change the symbol from “Single Symbol” to “Graduated.”\nUnder Value click the small down arrow on the right to select the “SITEINDX” column.\nIn the Color ramp field click the small down arrow on the right to select the “Viridis” color palette.\nAt the bottom of the symbology window, select Classify. This will classify the values in “SITEINDX” based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\nUnder Classify and Mode select “Equal Interval” and change the number of classes to “12”. Click Classify again.\nIn the Classes pain (the main white box) change these to 5 m classes as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\nClick Apply and OK. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer.\n\n\nStep 4 Create a site index map to export as a picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2.1\n\n\n\ncheck out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS QGIS Beautiful Maps\n\n\n\nSelect Project -&gt; New Print out Layout.

Drag the cursor around the blank area. Your map appears in this print layout.  NOTE: If you do not see a map in Layout View use Zoom Whole Page You may also need to reposition the map in the copied box using:\n\n\n\nRight click on your map and select Page Properties. Change the orientation from “landscape” to “portrait”.  \nRight click on the map again and select Item Properties this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\nUse  on the left-hand side to add a Legend (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\nUse  to add a Scale Bar. Click on the Item Properties box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\nUse  to add a Title.\nAdd a north arrow by clicking  and drag the curse to the map area.\nRight click on each item on your map and select Item Properties to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is Item properties icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.\n\nStep 5 Export your map as an image. Go to Layout and select Export as Image. Save the image the same location as your document you are recording lab responses.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWhat was the largest site index in m? What was the leading or dominant species for that polygon?

For example, if the answer was 103 m, we would use 40 m by 100 m spacing (not 105 m and not 103 m spacing), since forest land areas are often irregular in shape and this would “pull in” the systematic sampling grid to hopefully get enough plots.\nWhat would the spacing be, if this square spacing between plot centres was used instead? Again, in practice, we would round this answer down to the nearest 5 m to lay this out in the field.\nWhich of these two options would you choose to use and why?\n\n\nQuestion 9\nUsing the square spacing calculated in 2b and the plot size, select random co-ordinates for you first plot centre in the first “grid” of your systematic survey. Show all calculations you used to get the random co-ordinates and to make sure that the plot will fit within the first “grid square” of your systematic survey given these random co-ordinates and the plot dimensions.\n\n\nQuestion 10\nGiven a fixed project cost of $5,000 (i.e., truck rental and other equipment) and a per day cost of $1,000 for a 2-person crew with a production rate of eight plots per day:\n\nHow long would the survey take?\nWhat would the cost of this survey be?\n\n\n\nQuestion 11\nif the budget was set at $10,000:\n\nHow many plots could you have measured using the cost estimates in #10?\nWhat would the sampling intensity be for this fixed budget?\nWould this sampling intensity be more or less than the sampling intensity used in the sample plan (i.e., planned for 2%)?"

    "text": "Lab Overview\nFor timber supply (and other forest-level analyses), forecasts of each stand (or aggregates of similar stands) are needed to evaluate different management scenarios. For these analyses, yield tables for each stand type and management regime are needed to make these forecasts. In BC, VDYP is used for “unmanaged” stands and TIPSY is used for “managed” stands.

You will then simulate harvests of these stands and forecast future growth and yield post-harvest using TIPSY."

    "text": "Task 1 VDYP: Stand-level Yield Forecasts using VRI as Inputs\nYou looked at the 2014 VRI forest cover for MKRF in FRST 556, Ex.1 and 2. Using these data, all stands where western redcedar (Thuja plicata) was species with the largest percent were selected using QGIS. The attributes were exported as a .csv file, which was sorted, attributes were trimmed (i.e., some attributes were removed), and then the results were saved as CW dominated polygons trimmed.xlsx. Three of these stands in the northwestern part of MKRF were selected as stands of interest (CW dominated three polygons trimmed.xlsx). A few of the attributes of these polygons are shown in Table 8.1, and an image of the location of these stands is shown in Figure 1\n\n\nTable 7.1: Table 1.

Using VDYP, forecast these three stands from 0 to 250 years total age at 10-year intervals. You will get a yield a yield trajectory for each attribute in each of three stands (i.e., total volume per ha, merchantable volume per ha, stems per ha, etc. over time).\n\nTo get you started, first do the example stand in the Quick Intro to VDYP7.pdf (or .docx) file to get the yield trajectory, export these to EXCEL, trim off any labels, and then graphs the trajectories.\nUse similar steps to get forecasts for each of these three stands, and export growth and yield table to an EXCEL file. Include merchantable volume (12.5 + cm DBH) in your outputs, as well as the MAI’s for total and merchantable volume.

    "text": "Task 2 - Forecasting Using TIPSY\nIf these stands were harvested, we would need to forecast the stands again post-harvest. This is less complicated if stands were clearcut (i.e., called a regeneration cut or clearfelling in some places in the world), than if the stands were partially harvested.  We will assume that each of these stands was clearcut and you want to project the stands after harvest.  Following harvest:\n\nWe could assume that the stands will naturally follow the same trajectory as prior to harvest, meaning that they will start again at total age = 0 and follow the VDYP trajectories you created in Part I. \nAlternatively, we could plant the pre-harvest dominant species or a different species, control the planting density, and forecast each stand using this management regime. We would then forecast the stand using TIPSY.\n\nHere, we will assume that you will plant 1600 stems/ha of Coastal Douglas-fir following harvest. For each stand, show the forecast trajectories from 0 to 150 years by 10-year intervals, as you did previously for the existing stand using VDYP, but this time using TIPSY for “managed” stands.  You will need to use some of the VRI information from the old stand that was there prior to harvest in doing the trajectory (e.g., Site Index).  Before you do these stand forecasts, do the forecast for the example stand in the Quick Guide to Using TIPSY 4.4.docx (or pdf).\n\nQuestion 2 (TIPSY Questions)\nUsing EXCEL and the outputs from your VDYP and TIPSY forecasts:\n\nFor the post-harvest plan, 1600 stems/ha was used. What is the spacing between the trees (m) assuming square spacing? Show your calculations.\nCoastal Douglas-fir (FD) was used as the species to be planted post-harvest, whereas CW was the main species in the original stands at the time of the VRI inventory (Reference year: 1999). Since the Site Index was for CW not for FD, is the TIPSY forecast reliable? Explain briefly, considering the ecology of these three species in CWH.\nGraph the total volume per ha (m3/ha) over total age (years) for the post-harvest TIPSY forecast versus the VDYP forecast for each of these stands (NOTE: The TIPSY forecast will be for 0 to 150 years only).  Compare these trajectories, and explain why they are different using principles of stand and tree growth for the existing stand versus the post-harvest planted stand.\nIs the cost of planting justified? Briefly discuss under what circumstances this cost would be justified for these three stands."

Some parts of the tree will not be included in this merchantable volume and will have a zero volume, namely the stump segment, and the parts of the tree above 10.0 cm top diameter inside bark. You will have to iteratively modify the “percent of height” column to obtain an estimated 10.0 cm top diameter inside bark. For the merchantable height and volume calculations all sections above the 10.0 cm diameter length will have a zero volume. What is the merchantable tree volume? Again, keep four decimals only.\n\n\nQuestion 5\nDetermine the estimated merchantable height (i.e., from the ground to merchantable 10 cm limit) and the estimated merchantable length (i.e., stump to merchantable limit) of this tree. You will not be modifying your Merchantable Volume worksheet for this; instead, use the worksheet to get the answers (i.e. when is the tree too small in width). The merchantable length and merchantable height will be in m. By convention, we keep one decimal place for tree heights and for merchantable lengths. NOTE: We often keep two decimals for distances, and for log lengths, however, and we keep one decimal place for DBH in cm.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nWhat is the merchantable volume over total volume proportion? If the tree was larger, would this proportion be smaller or larger?\n\n\nQuestion 7\nHow many logs of 2.5 m long could we get from this tree, within the boundaries of the stump height and the minimum diameter inside bark of 10.0 cm (i.e. how many 2.5 m logs fit within the merchantable length limit)? What could be done with the rest of the merchantable part of the tree?\n\n\nQuestion 8 Bonus\nWhat is the value of the first log (i.e., the largest one starting at stump height) in CAD, assuming it is a high-quality log (i.e., no decay, no knots, few growth rings per inch, and no defects)? HINT: You will need to look up log prices online. You may also need the log grade given the species, log size, and condition to estimate a likely log price."

However, on one hand, the volume models would be expected to be more precise for estimating tree volume since they estimate this directly whereas the volume using the taper model are calculated by first calculating the estimated diameters inside bark up the stem. On the other hand, taper models can be used for more than just estimated total volume (i.e., merchantable volume, log volumes, etc. as you did in Task 1 & 2)."

Also, consider how tall the top height is expected to be at 250 years old (breast height age).\nFor each stand - what would the estimated top height be 10 years from now in 2023 for this stand? NOTE: The PROJ_Age = 218 years as of 2014, the Reference Date).\nBased on what you know about these stand types - is it likely that the stand would survive to 2033?\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nYou have two primarily Coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) stands growing in the CWH BEC zone. Stand #1 is currently 70 years old (breast height age) with a top height of 30 m and Stand #2 is currently 50 years old (breast height age) with a top height of 35 m.\n\nUse Site Tools to get the site index for each stand.\nWhich stand is more productive based on site index (i.e., higher site index)?\nWhat other attributes would you need on each stand to forecast them using VDYP 7? Also, what would these be called (i.e., the variable labels) in the VRI attributes? HINT: What variables did you use in Exercise 6 to forecast stands using VDYP and where they called in the VRI attribute file? You also have 2014_VRI_Photo_Interpretation_Procedures_Ver30_final.pdf with details on each attribute.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nIn Exercise 6, the site index values for the three polygons were for western redcedar (CW) as the dominant species. However, post-harvest, you simulated the yields after planting 1600 stems/ha of coastal Douglas-fir (FD). For that, you had to decide on what site index to use for the coastal Douglas fir post-harvest (e.g., same as for CW?).  Alternatively, you could have used SIBEC relationships to get SI estimates for the post-harvest coastal Douglas fir given the BEC site series (see sibec2013approx_final.xlsx). \nUsing QGIS, the VRI 2014 and the BEC layers were loaded for MKRF. Then, a query was used to locate the three stands from Ex. 6. Since VRI polygons are delineated based on the current forest that is on site, whereas BEC is the vegetation that could be on the site, the forest cover and site series polygons do not have the same boundaries.  As a result, one VRI stand may include several BEC site series/site association polygons.  \nFor the smallest of the three stands from Ex. 6, POLYID=621 (shown in green in Fig. 1), the BEC polygons were then overlaid onto this VRI forest cover polygon (shown in red in Fig. 1). Three of these BEC site series/site association polygons that overlap with POLYID=621 have been highlighted (label is circled in black).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Selected CW dominated 2014 VRI polygon (green) with an overlay of site series (red with labels). Three site series polygons that overlap with the VRI polygon are circled in black.\n\n\n\nWe will use one these site series/site associations located within the VRI 2014 polygon. Specifically we will use FdHw-Salal (03) site series/site association within the CWHdm BEC subzone (Vancouver Region), and the SIBEC table in EXCEL:\n\nList the estimated SI index values for each species given in the SIBEC table for this site series/site association in a table;\nAdd both the common and the full Latin names for each tree species (includes the credit for the person who named the species); and\nInclude the number of plots on which these estimated SI from BEC values are based. A blank in this cell means there were no plots and these SI values are estimated from a similar site series/site association.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: This is the Vancouver region. ii) See the file, VRI_Ground_Sampling_species codes only_2017.pdf under for the VRI species codes. iii) You will need to use the internet to find whom to credit for each Latin name – try looking for “Silvics of North America” on the internet for these (excellent source!). iv) Finally, for coastal Douglas-fir or for coastal lodgepole pine, include the variety in the Latin name, since the variety of each of these species greatly changes growth characteristics.\n\n\n\nRepeat this using the other two circled site series/site associations that overlap with this VRI polygon.\nHow reliable are these SIBEC estimates?  Consider: What information was included in these tables that might indicate reliability?\nHow would using these SIBEC estimates for FD SI change the forecast you did using TIPSY for this stand in Exercise 6 (i.e., instead of using the VRI 2014 CW SI=21 for this polygon)?\n\nBriefly explain how the yields would change depending on what you assumed for the FD SI post-harvest.\nThen, which would you choose to use? Or would you use more than one approach? Justify your choice."

There are other models (e.g., PrognosisBC) also available for use by BC forest professionals.\nTo become familiar with how VDYP and TIPSY can be used to forecast the growth and yield of stands, you will forecast three polygons from MKRF. You will use the VRI forest inventory, layer 1 attributes, as inputs to VDYP. This links the VDYP model to forest inventory information, which is what happens for “unmanaged” stands in timber supply analyses.

However, other yield tables (e.g., from MGM or PrognosisBC) could be used via over-riding VDYP and TIPSY direct links to each stand. • Woodlot also removes lakes and other areas that are not forested; removals of entire polygons or parts of polygons in analyses are also possible. • Woodlot provides a spatial map of different management scenarios that you might run, along with summary tables and graphs that are useful. • HOWEVER, Woodlot does not simulate adjacency constraints. For example, if any area is harvested, it is possible that the neighboring area will be harvested in the next time period. Further, there still are some limits to what else you can do using Woodlot.\nImportant updates to Woodlot 4 • Woodlot 4 was developed for timber supply use as an update for woodlot 3.2. It has many important updates on integrating shapefiles • Some important updates are that it has no size limites and has non-declingin even flow harvest forecast (this means it cannot be used in a timber supply forecast under TSAs) •"

These will be forecasted post-harvest again using TIPSY.\nClick on the “Calculate Yields” button to use VDYP to forecast the existing stands.\n\nThis will run VDYP for each stand using the critical VRI forest attributes to drive VDYP (as you did for three polygons in Exercise 6, but you did that manually entering in the needed VRI attributes into VDYP).\n\n\nAfter calculation, there are some polygons left to forecast. A place for us to investigate more!\nClick on the Polygon View tab\nCollapse the non-FMLB folders and the FMLB folder in the Polygons list. Of the 458 polygons, there are 419 FMLB polygons and the remaining polygons are non-FMLB polygons, grouped into four types (lakes, etc.) (See screenshot next page).\nExpand the Non-FMLB folders and double-click on the first of the non-FMLB (Lake) polygons. Click on the buttons (Small map, Comments, etc.) to see the map of that polygon, as well as some of the attributes.  NOTE:  The selected polygons will show up with a “hatched” symbol.  To remove this symbol, double-click on the polygon symbol and it will go back to the original symbol.  ALSO, at any time you can see the full map of all polygons by clicking on the “Map View” tab.\n\nYou should now have a screen that looks like this: \n10.0.3 Q1 {.unnumbered} How big is this lake? What is the BC landcover type for this lake polygon? You can use the VRI information to understand this. Note, there are five different land cover classes that go from general to specific.\n10.0.4 Q2 {.unnumbered} Deselect this lake polygon and choose another lake polygon. Provide a screenshot, and add a sentence that notes the size of the lake and the BC landcover type\n\nDouble-click on one of the non-FMLB (Non-vegetated) polygons and use the tabs to see the map of that polygon, as well as some of the attributes. What is the BC land cover for this polygon? Then, double-click on a few others in the same group.\n10.0.5 Q3 {.unnumbered} When we first forecasted using VDYP we did so for 419 polygons. Why are there only 419 polygons out of 458 to forecast?\n10.0.6 Q4 {.unnumbered} What are the BC land cover types for these Non-vegetated polygons? Write down the polygon numbers and the land cover types (i.e., the five land cover class levels) for polygons 444, 488, 517, and 978.\n10.0.7 Q5 {.unnumbered} Check polygon 509. Why was this included in the non-FMLB (Non-vegetated) list of polygons? Could it have been included in the non-FMLB (VRI) list? What about the FMLB list? Use the information you have for this polygon as evidence to support your answer.\nDouble-click on one of the non-FMLB (VRI) polygons and use the tabs to see the map of that polygon, as well as some of the attributes. What is the BC land cover for this polygon? Double-click to see the information on a few others in the same group.\n10.0.8 Q6 {.unnumbered} What are the BC land cover types for these non-FMLB (VRI) polygons? Write down the polygon number and land cover types for polygons 540, 754, and 1012.\n10.0.9 Q7 {.unumbered} Could any of these non-FMLB (VRI) polygons be forested in the future? Consider what would have to be done in the way of management interventions and the cost of these interventions (in a general way, not with specific costs) to create a forested polygon for some of these non-FMLB polygons in your answer.\nCollapse the non-FMLB folder and expand the FMLB folder. Look at the list of polygons that are part of the FMLB. You will see that some of them have the symbol (box) colored green and some are brown (or could be blue). Others have a question mark.\n\nGreen polygons: The green ones are polygons that meet the minimum harvest criteria that you set (e.g., minimum DBH and volume per ha) without management interventions (i.e., can be harvested sometime in the forecast period). The yields of the current stand were obtained using VDYP. The assumed harvest was clearcut and post-harvest, the yields would be forecasted using VDYP assuming the stand would be eventually identical to the stand pre-harvest. This could be changed to use TIPSY post-harvest and simulate a planted/naturally regenerated stand with different characteristics than pre-harvest, or using VDYP for partial harvests (via a process that gives approximate yield post-harvest).\n\nBrown (or blue?) polygons: The brown (or blue?) polygons do not meet the minimum harvest criteria set within the harvest period (e.g., never reach 350 m3/ha or do not reach the min. DBH required), OR are currently NSR or NC:\n\nNSR: Not Satisfactorily Restocked. These sites are considered productive, but not currently restocked. You can choose to Restock the stand and indicate the regeneration delay (when will regeneration occur?), and then by indicating the numbers of types of planted or natural trees. These stands would then be forecasted using TIPSY. (Not done in Scenario 1).\nNC: Non-Commercial Cover. These are areas that are “non-commercial or damaged sites” that could be converted to productive forests. You would specify “Reforest” which would begin with removal of all trees as part of the stand conversion. TIPSY or VDYP can be used to forecast the future forest. (Not done in Scenario 1).\n\nPolygons with a question mark: The polygons with a question mark (12 of these…. remember 12 polygons were left to forecast out of the 419 FMLB polygons) are likely recent harvests. There is no VDYP forecast for these polygons since VDYP requires the species composition, site index, crown closure, and age as the minimum inputs to forecast the yields of an existing stand. You will need to fix each one of these to use TIPSY instead.\n\nDouble-click on a few of the green-colored FMLB polygons to see the current VRI information as well as the forecasted yields. For example, for Polygon 456, here are two screenshots:\n \n\nImportant NOTE on ages: In the graph, there are three ages: 1) “Harvest age” is when the stand meets the harvest criteria you set in the Project panel; 2) “Culmination Age” (i.e., biological rotation age at maximum m.a.i.); and 3) “Reference age” which is age of this stand in 2020 (the date for the VRI projected data) ..!). The stand could be harvested by Woodlot at the “Harvest Age” or the culmination age, whichever is greater!\n\nWe can control a lot in protocols for example . For example, if we wanted to add an area for reserves we could reduct the areas as follows:\n\nLet’s hone in on the polygons that we did not calculate use VDYP to calculate a projection with - even though they are FMLB polygons. First, double-click on polygon 1154 - here the VRI information says that this is a non-vegetation polygon (BC land class), but there is a super high index value (34.0, calculated with SIBEC)\nDouble-click on all of the polygons that have a ? this will add them into your ‘selected’\n\nClick on the Map View to see where these polygons are around the landscape\nClick on Tabular View tab\nAt the top of the table of polygons, choose “VRI” as the column filter. Also, click on “Selected Only”, “Friendly Headers” and “Expand Codes”.\nAll of these polygons had no trees at the time of the inventory (Ref Date is 2000 or 2004).  All of these have a BEC estimated SI value (SIBEC) and all were included in the FMLB.  \n\nTo project the yields for these 12 stands, you will need to click on each one and change from the VDYP projection pre- and post harvest to TIPSY\n\nStarting with polygon 1510 change the left side with VDYP to be “Clearcut (Reforest To)”\nFor the existing Forest box on the left, change the age from  to 0 years.\nChange the right from VDYP to TIPSY and change the species to Coastal Douglas fir. It will be 100% coastal Douglas fir and natural regeneration. The bottom box should look as follows:\n\nHit “Calculate Yield” tab - note that this will decrease the total number of polygons we have to down 1.\n\nRepeat this for all polygons until there are no polygons left to do.\nReturn to the Map View tab once more - look at the map of polygons.\nNow we will simulate a forecast for our scenario for 250 years. To do so follow these steps:\n\nClick on the Calculations Tab. Now you will simulate the harvests and calculate the harvest that might be sustained over a 250-year period (although Woodlot assumes “non-declining flow”).  You will also obtain a list indicating when each polygon might be harvested. \nFor this order of harvest, put a check mark for the Oldest First and remove any other check marks:\n This creates a harvest schedule list of polygons in order of harvest, including harvest starts and stops, the age, and the volume that would be harvested (screenshot next).  You can click on other items to get more information as well.\nThen, click on Calculate and leave this as Auto – Harvest Rate (m3/year) at the bottom of the screen.\nThis creates a harvest schedule list of polygons in order of harvest, including harvest starts and stops, the age, and the volume that would be harvested (screenshot next).  You can click on other items to get more information as well. You can also click on each polygon and see where that polygon is planned for harvesting\nThe graph included above is a stacked graph of non-harvestable volume (the bottom line) + mature timber (middle line) + immature  volume (top line). \nWe also see that the AAC and the LRSY are included at the base \nClick on the Plotsy icon to get a better graph of the Standing Volume over time  \n[NOTE: The y-axis label says m3 X 100,000 versus time]. Take a screen shot of your graph (Questions 9 and 10).  Take a screen shot of your graph and make sure to add this to your Ex9 WORD file.\nNow back on the Woodlot screen, Click on Reports Age Distribution Map.  Take a screenshot and add this to your Ex9 WORD file.  (Question 13 and Q14). NOTE: This graph shows the ages across the x-axis, and then the colors indicate the forecast period. For example, to “see” the age class distribution at the beginning of the forecast period, ignore all other bars except the 1st one at each age (were the green bars for me, Year 0). To “see” the age distribution at the end of the forecast period, only pay attention to the last bar for each age class (were the pink bars for me, Year 250).\nClick on Reports and create a Woodlot Report. This prepares a document for you (an .rtf file than can be saved as a .docx file) with some outputs already entered into the report. Save your Woodlot report somewhere to access again.\n10.0.10 Q8.  What was the AAC for Scenario 1? \n10.0.11 Q9.  Add captions to your screen shot of the volume stocks forecast in your Ex9 WORD file (i.e., Figure 1 ??add the description?) and to your screen shot of the age distribution over time in your Ex9 WORD file (i.e., Figure 2 ?add the description???).\n10.1 ### Q10.  What happened in this forecasted management scenario? Refer to your stocks over time and age distribution over time graphs, and your scenario1.docx Woodlot report in answering these questions.1) Were the volume stocks maintained over time (i.e., almost the same at the beginning and end of the forecast period) or were they lower or higher at the end of the period than at the start of the period?  How much were these stocks over time?  2) What happened to the age class distribution at the beginning of the forecast period (which bar color for Year 0) versus the end of the forecast period (which color for Year 250)?"

Note, there are five different land cover classes that go from general to specific.\nDeselect this lake polygon and choose another lake polygon. Provide a screenshot, and add a sentence that notes the size of the lake and the BC landcover type.\nWhen we first forecasted using VDYP we did so for 419 polygons. Why are there only 419 polygons out of 458 to forecast?\nWhat are the BC land cover types for these Non-vegetated polygons? Write down the polygon numbers and the land cover types (i.e., the five land cover class levels) for polygons 444, 488, 517, and 978.\nCheck polygon 509. Why was this included in the non-FMLB (Non-vegetated) list of polygons? Could it have been included in the non-FMLB (VRI) list? What about the FMLB list? Use the information you have for this polygon as evidence to support your answer.\nWhat are the BC land cover types for these non-FMLB (VRI) polygons? Write down the polygon number and land cover types for polygons 540, 754, and 1012.\nCould any of these non-FMLB (VRI) polygons be forested in the future? Consider what would have to be done in the way of management interventions and the cost of these interventions (in a general way, not with specific costs) to create a forested polygon for some of these non-FMLB polygons in your answer.\nWhat was the AAC for Scenario 1? \nFor scenario 1, add captions to your screen shot of the volume stocks forecast in your Ex9 WORD file (i.e., Figure 1 ??add the description?) and to your screen shot of the age distribution over time in your Ex9 WORD file.\nWhat happened in this forecasted management scenario?
